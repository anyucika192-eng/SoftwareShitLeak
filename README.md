    Im Leakin this shit becuse the other dude ( 도쿄다이드 ) who had the DC server was a pain in the ass


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Story/Backround Of The Script

( When i say dude i mean 도쿄다이드 but i dont wanna ctrl c - v the name all the time )

So dude is a close friend of mine but he is a pain in the ass
At the start dude shown me his scripts for roblox that he pasted form hes 1-2 year old projetcs https://imgur.com/a/b0hYEZR
and just sayin and explaining the whole thing. For fun i said i can help so i did. I Lerned basic lua in like 2 hours to help dude
After i did i just lerned his UI and everything. Next day he made a compleatly diffrent UI and pasted some cool fetaures. In a dc call we talked what we wanna do with this so i had the idea to implement my goofy webstore into the script( https://softwareshopz.mysellauth.com/ ) After we wanted this to be a Rivals Cheat so i coded a VERY VERY simple aimbot we talkin like mvp terms shit. Then i did the aimbot part and made it like half shit - in Arsenal the aimbot was 100% good in rivals 500+ fov was good under that u were flickering everywhere. after i added smoothing and a fake Rivals Anti-Cheat bypasser https://imgur.com/a/b0hYEZR

The part that i am very like mentaly anal fucked by is that the whole shit he coded was like Chatgpt or a very bad paste and i fixed it like everything (where u see fixed by Grandma i did 60% of thoose features).

After everything i wanted to make our discord server seem a little more valid so i bought like 1k realistic bots becuse the dc server he pasted from a temple had like 12 members 3 of em are owner-admin and 4 are bots
After that he started sayin that im a dumb fuck and why i did that ext.. and i did nothing for this project and that he feels sorry to the only customer who bought something. (we more like me made ~8$ under 6 days)

And just a recap of what he did and what i did

dude did:

Pasted a script from chatgpt
"Added"(Pasted) fake stuff to the script
Made a discrord server with a temple
played boss


What i did:

Made the website

-- Updated : buggy UI, Aimbot, Chams
-- Maintaned : Key sytem, webstore

## About the Script ( not fucking around just explaining )

This shit is written in lua. The --"something" things are mainly hungarian translate it so you understand
What works and worth pasteing -- Chams, the whole movement tab, aimbot, fakestuff, inf jump, spinbot, UI
